The reactor can be made from multiple different components:

- **Reactor Controller**: The heat of your reactor. This block needs to be placed once somewhere on the walls. It needs to be interacted with to assemble / update the reactor.
The GUI shows the current status of the reactor, along with the temperatures of the components and statistics. The GUI only shows the first layer of the interior.

- **Reactor Wall**: The reactor wall is a very strong and highly blast-resistant piece of the reactor. It should encase the entire frame.

- **Reactor Rod**: Reactor rods are interior components that need to be supplied with uranium or plutonium pellets. A fuel port over each rod stack is needed
to insert the fuel. It is available in single, double or quad rods, that will generate heat and energy depending on the amount of rods.

- **Reactor Heat Pipe**: Heat pipes absorb heat from neighboring fuel rods, and then spread the heat among neighboring heat vents. The maximum transferred
heat amount from a neighbor component is based on the temperature difference between the 2 components:
  > temperatureDiff / 4 + 10

- **Reactor Neutron Reflector**: These blocks will reflect the neutrons of neighboring fuel rods, increasing their efficiency.

- **Reactor Heat Vent**: Vents remove heat from the hottest neighboring component. The amount of heat removed is based on the temperature of the neighboring
component. Hotter components will result in more heat removed. The exact formula is:
  > neighborHeat / 100 + 4

- **Reactor Heat Absorbers**: Heat Absorbers can remove a fixed amount of heat from all neighboring components. This means it is more efficient when
surrounded by components that need to be cooled. However, it does require a constant supply of coolant in the form of ice (or blue/packed ice) in the coolant port
above the absorber stack. The amount of coolant used is fixed, and does not increase with more sides being cooled. Each tick, **16** units
of heat are removed from each neighbor.

- **Reactor Energy Port**: The energy port is used to output the energy generated by the reactor. Each port may output up to 25 000 RF/t.

- **Reactor Fuel Port**: Needs to be placed on the outer ceiling of the reactor, with fuel rods beneath. This is where fuel pellets can be inserted.

- **Reactor Coolant Absorber Port**: Needs to be placed on the outer ceiling of the reactor, with heat absorbers beneath.
This is where coolant in the form of ice/blue ice/packed ice can be inserted.

- **Reactor Redstone Port**: An energy signal to a redstone port will disable the intake of new fuels. Any fuel pellet that has already started burning needs
to be finished before the reactor will fully shut of with a redstone signal to a port. The port can also be used with a comparator to output data. It has 3 modes:
Energy, Active Rod Count, and Temperature. To cycle between the modes, simply right-click the port.

## Fuel Rod Activity

Each fuel rod will consume a fixed amount of fuel from the fuel ports above. Each fuel pellet has a different fuel capacity. Use JEI/REI/EMI to view the pellet
usage for specific capacity data. Each single rod will use 1 capacity unit, a double rod uses 2, and a quad rod uses 4.

When burning fuel, each rod will generate neutron pulses. Each pulse creates a specific amount of energy (64 by default). The more pulses a rod receives,
the more energy it also creates.
Each rod sends and receives one pulse by default. However, if a neighbor component is also a fuel rod,
it will also hit the neighboring component with a pulse. Neutron Reflectors can be used to send a pulse back to its origin, acting a similar rod type as neighbor.

Double/Quad pulses will hit the other rods in the same block with pulses, and also send out 2 or 4 pulses to neighbors.

A single rod will generate 1 internal pulse, a double rod 4, and a quad rod 12.

The amount of heat generates is based on the total pulses of a rod (internal + external pulses):
> pulses / 2 * pulses + 4
