You can design your reactors as you wish. In general, dual or quad rods are more fuel-usage efficient (e.g. they generate more total RF per pellet), but are also
much harder to cool.

You can use active cooling with the heat absorbers, or passive cooling with just heat vents. When surrounded by active components on all sides, a single absorber
may absorb up to 16 * 4 = 64 Heat per Tick, but does require ice to work. You can create ice from water with the industrial chiller.

A single heat vent can vent heat based on the hottest neighboring block. At 1000 Degrees, it will vent 14 Heat, and at 0 Degrees just 4. Depending on your
goals you probably want to either spread the heat with heat spreaders to many vents, or surround a few absorbers with heat pipes.

Based on the provided formulas, here's a small table that did some of the math for you:

| Rod Type   | Rod Count | Internal Pulses | External Pulses | Total Pulses | Heat Generated | RF Generated | Vents needed at 0 C | Vents Needed at 1000 C | Absorber Contacts needed |
| ---------- | --------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------ | -------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |

Reactor design can vary. A small reactor may be good enough for early-midgame power generation, while massive reactors may be needed in the lategame.
When testing designs, it is often advisable to use small pellets to allow faster shutdown should the reactor begin overheating.

Usually a few fuel rods are surround by heat pipes and cooling components, as below:

For bigger reactors with denser rods, you'll need a lot more cooling. Note that not all interior blocks need to be filled:
