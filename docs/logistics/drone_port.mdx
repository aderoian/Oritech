## Description
The drone port allows you to transport items and fluid across vast distances using flying drones. It requires a drone port at both
the takeoff and landing positions to be built and powered.

## Usage
### Targeting a Drone Port
Once built, assign the target port using a target designator item. Bind it to the targeted drone port by shift + right-clicking
the target port. Then, on the port you wish to send materials from, open the UI and place the designator into the special item slot.

### Distance Limitations
The target port must be at least 50 blocks away, and the area it's in needs to be chunk-loaded.

### Sending/Receiving Materials
A drone port can only send materials to one specific target port, but a port can receive materials from multiple ports. However,
each drone takes a few seconds to land, so if materials arrive too frequently, one receiving port may be overloaded when
targeted by multiple ports.

### Travel Cost
The time it takes to deliver materials is constant, regardless of the distance the drone has to fly. However, the energy
cost increases with distance.Energy cost is calculated as follows:

`sqrt(distance) * 50 + 1024`

### Sending Fluids
To send fluids, a fluid addon must be added to the drone port. Both the sending and receiving ports must have the fluid
addon for the drone to transport fluids.

### Redstone Control
The redstone addon may be added to allow the drone port to be controlled by redstone signals and send comparator signals
through the redstone addon.

**Modes:**
- **Power Measure:** Comparator signal strength is based on the amount of energy stored in the drone port.
- **Inventory Slot Measure:** Comparator signal strength is based on the largest amount of a variant of material, either
items in the target slot or fluid in the tank.
- **Progress Measure:** Comparator signal strength is based on the progress of the drone port.
- **Activity Measure:** Comparator signal strength is based on whether the drone port is idle, sending, or receiving.
- **Input Control:** Power the redstone addon to disable the drone port from sending or receiving materials.
