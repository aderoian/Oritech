Uranium is a highly energetic material that can be found deep underground. It is usually found on cave walls between Y -64 -> Y -24.
Patches of Uranium will be created on cave walls, and it will not generate without air next to it. Some of the ores
may be covered with uranium crystal.

The glowing **Uranium Crystals** can be harvested similar to uranium ore. However, they can also be destroyed with an enderic laser to drop plutonium dust
instead, which is much more valuable. However, unlike amethysts, the uranium crystals will not regrow.
